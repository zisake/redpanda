	// declare PersistentPreRun hooks on each command root (such as rpk
	// api), validating them there and them passing them down to its
	// subcommands. However, Cobra only executes the last hook defined in
	// the command chain. Since NewTopicCommand requires a PersistentPreRun
	// hook to initialize the sarama Client and Admin, it overrides whatever
	// PersistentPreRun hook was declared in a parent command.
	// An alternative would be to declare a global var to hold the global
	// flag's value, but this would require flattening out the package
	// hierarchy to avoid import cycles (parent command imports child
	// command's package, child cmd import parent cmd's package to access
	// the flag's value), but this leads to entangled code.
	// As a cleaner workaround, the flags are provided through a
	// closure with references to the required values (the config file
	// path, the list of brokers passed through --brokers).
